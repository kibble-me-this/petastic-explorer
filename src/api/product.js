      "Directions: Weaning Puppies: Start puppies on Rachael Ray\u2122 Nutrish Zero Grain Salmon & Sweet Potato Recipe Dog Food as soon as they begin to chew on solid food, usually 3\u20134 weeks of age. Allow them to eat as much as they want until fully weaned (6\u20138 weeks of age).Growing Puppies: Puppies should be completely weaned by 6\u20138 weeks of age. After weaning, feed them all they want 3 times daily to 6 months of age and 2 times daily to 12 months of age. If desired, Rachael Ray\u2122 Nutrish Zero Grain Salmon & Sweet Potato Recipe Dog Food can be fed moistened. To feed moistened, mix 1/4 cup of water to 2 cups of Rachael Ray\u2122 Nutrish Zero Grain Salmon & Sweet Potato Recipe Dog Food.Adult Dogs: Adult dogs with normal activity may be fed once daily. Depending on your dog's age and activity, serving sizes may vary slightly from the recommended daily feeding guide portions.For pregnant or lactating females, feed daily up to 3 times the amount suggested for their non-pregnant weight.Talk to your veterinarian about your dog's ideal weight and adjust your amounts accordingly.Transition Instructions Because Rachael Ray Nutrish may offer different ingredients than your dog is used to, it may take up to ten days for your dog's system to become acclimated to Nutrish. Slowly mix with his other food over a five- to ten-day period until your dog is solely eating Nutrish",

That's a tenth of the calories of traditional dry cat treats and more than 1000 times the moisture (8% vs. 91% moisture). In addition, we've also added Taurine to help with their vision, digestions and heart health, as well as, Vitamin E for immunity and Green Tea Extract for its natural antioxidants. What they're missing? They're grain-free, preservative-free, carrageenan-free and free from artificial colors, making them a cat treat you can feel good about feeding. Designed to be hand fed, you can use to help calm the feistiest of outdoor ferals or treat your pampered indoor pussycat. They can be used a dry/canned cat food topper or to assist with giving medications. Available in 11 savory flavors (Tuna, Tuna with Chicken, Chicken, Tuna with Scallop, Chicken with Scallop, Tuna with Salmon, Chicken with Cheese, Chicken with Shrimp, Chicken with Crab, Tuna with Beef and Chicken with Beef), you'll be able to find a flavor that your kitty will crave no matter what stage of life they are (kitten to senior).

      "Dog Lift Harness with Reflective Handle: The padded handle not only offers protection but also ensures an immediate and secure grip. It allows you to assist your dog over obstacles or gain instant control during outings or training sessions. The soft handle becomes invaluable when your dog encounters other dogs or crosses streets, providing you with instant grip control and assistance to prevent potential dangers.",
      "Full Body Reflective Design: The escape-proof harness features a full-body reflective fly-woven fabric, ensuring excellent visibility in the dark for safe walks both day and night. Bid farewell to worries about your dog going unnoticed by cars during nighttime strolls.",
      "Customizable Fit with 5 Adjustable Points: Our harness offers a customized fit with 5 adjustable points, ensuring maximum movement and a bit of stretch for a snug fit as your dog grows. The inclusion of 4 quick-release buckles makes the harness easy to put on, saving you time. Wider range of adjustments for all-shapes of dogs.",
      "Effective Controls: The front and back are equipped with 2 sturdy metal D-ring leash clips, providing effective control with minimal effort. The metal D-ring at the chest discourages pulling, enabling you to redirect your furry friend.",
      "Provides All-Day Comfort: The breathable padded air mesh offers maximum coziness during walks, training, and any outdoor activities. Built-in 4mm soft sponges minimize skin friction, offering more protection, and the semi-back coverage provides much more breathability for added comfort. While bigger buckles may seem bulkier, they provide an additional layer of safety for your furry friend.",

With an easy treatment regimen of shampooing 2-3 times per week initially and then less frequently as skin improves, you can give your pet relief from symptoms including an inflamed scalp, greasy skin, rashes, and scaly skin similar to dandruff that are caused by seborrhea (most commonly caused by bacterial or yeast infections). The veterinary-grade ingredients in our topical bottle of antiseborrheic and antiparasitic shampoo for dogs help treat, hydrate and relieve multiple skin conditions such as seborrhea, mange, parasitic and bacterial infections. Powerful ingredients like salicylic acid, coal tar and micronized sulfur help treat the condition, while colloidal oatmeal and allantoin hydrates skin and promotes healing. You can also use this antiparasitic mange shampoo for dogs with other topical spot-on flea and tick treatments. Great for pets with allergy-prone and yeasty skin! We know that your dogs are more than just pets - they are part of the family - so Veterinary Formula Clinical Care designs premium medicated products that pet parents can actually afford. Your dog will feel fast acting relief from skin infections and you&#8217;ll notice that your dog&#8217;s skin is calmer, less inflamed and the itching is controlled &#8211; making you both happy and able to focus on more important things like walks, fetch and snuggles. It&#8217;s important to determine the cause of the underlying issue, so please consult your veterinarian if skin issues become a consistent problem.
